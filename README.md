Write an Angular application with one view in the view including a reactive form (better to use a form builder for this). The form should include the following fields:
- image - file input (with the possibility upload an image on the page)
- animation drop-down (several options with the type of animation, “slide in from top” or “zoom in from bottom” and others that you can imagine. 
Also, add the button “download HTML file” that on click create an HTML file and run downloading of that. The HTML file must contain code that you just set with the form (HTML page with an image that has animation).


Optional 
If you can add additional fields: "image size", "container width", "container height", "image position (x and y)". And add the possibility to set the container to the image, and position and crop the image inside this container.
